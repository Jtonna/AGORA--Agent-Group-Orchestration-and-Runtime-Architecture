    <about>
      This is your bootstrap configuration. Complete these tasks in order, then enter the startup lifecycle phase.
    </about>

    <task order="1" section="mail">
      <action>Understand the mail system</action>
      <notes>
        DO NOT read mail.xml yet - just understand that mail exists from these notes.
        Mail is core infrastructure - it is always available to you.
        Every lifecycle phase involves communication. All help requests are blocking.
        COMPLETE goes to supervisor only. COLLABORATION REQUEST is peer-to-peer only.
      </notes>
    </task>

    <task order="2" section="lifecycle">
      <action>Understand the lifecycle phases</action>
      <notes>
        Follow each phase in sequence starting with startup.
        Fixed phases cannot be modified. Runtime is where your behaviors execute.
      </notes>
    </task>

    <task order="3" section="behaviors">
      <action>Review the behavior catalog</action>
      <notes>
        Read only the behavior name, description, and when criteria.
        Select behaviors that match your task requirements.
        DO NOT read the behavior file until you enter runtime and need that capability.
        You can use multiple behaviors simultaneously - you decide how they work together.
        New behaviors can be added mid-execution via mail instructions from your supervisor.
